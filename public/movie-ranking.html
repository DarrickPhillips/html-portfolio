<h2>My Top 3 All-Time Favorites</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tommy Boy</h3>
<p>Chris Farley was a hilarious actor. David Spade is a great counterpart.<br />
Great Comedy of the 90's.</p>
<h3>Black Sheep</h3>
<p>Another great comedy by Chris Farley and David Spade.<br />
They were such a comedic duo.</p>
<h3>Army of Darkness</h3>
<p>Bruce Campbell as Ash in a great Horror mixed with slapstick comedy.<br />
Classic special effects, archaic CGI, and cliche 90's dialogue.</p>
